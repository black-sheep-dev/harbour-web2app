## Current state of development

The development is a proof of concept at the moment.  
At the moment it is only possible to run one app at once. 
There is a problem with xulrunner which prevents multiple windows from the same app.

At the moment the app ist not really functional at all.

- Create / Edit / Delete webapps
- Run the created webapps with icon from phones app menu

## Planned Features

- Customize icon shape
- Add favicon from webapp to customized icon
